# Efficient_Data_Stream_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb

In renewable energy and the oil & gas sector, performance data is obtained using sensors to monitor various parameters like production, pressure, temperature, and flows.therfore The data obtained forms the basis of ensuring that the equipment can operate with maximum efficiency and safety to cut down on operational costs and ensure continued production.

Therefore, the detection of anomalies in the performance data is vital to :

1- Early detection of problems : It allows one to see faults before they happen.

2- Safety assurance : It prevents fatal accidents from occurring.

3- Reduction of operating cost : The need for emergency repairs will be less.

4- Improvement in operating efficiency : Equipment performance is maintained at optimum.

5- Regulatory compliance : One may comply with laws and regulations.

6 - Improvement in continuity of business operation : There won't be any unexpected stops in the lines of production.
